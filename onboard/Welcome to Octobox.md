# Welcome to the Octobox beta!

**Octobox is a tool that lets you collect information from anywhere and store it in one place.**

You can organize your things using collections, stacks and tags - this way you'll never get confused, even if you have a lot of files.

Markdown makes your notes and todos pretty. Learn more about formatting here: https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics

A browser extension to let you keep all the images and snippets found online is coming *this August* and new features are already being worked on and will be added constantly.

Email _help@useoctobox.com_ or tweet _@OctoboxApp_ if you need any help or have any questions.

*Have fun using Octobox and let us know how you like it!*
